###Le Merge De Conflicte

This is a repo that is used, in class, to demonstrate how to solve a merge conflict when it occurs with your teammates. Sometimes Github will automatically solve the issue, other times it cannot and requires human intervention.

Merge conflicts are a common part of working with GitHub. Do not fear the conflicts, my friends! All will be well. W will solve the issues!

This is an increased amount of content that was added through GitHub. I am entirely purposely causing a merge conflict to further my educational knowledge on Github.
